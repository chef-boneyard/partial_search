Description
===========

Partial Search is a new search API currently available only on Opscode
Hosted Chef that can be used to reduce the network bandwidth and the
memory used by chef-client to process search results.

This cookbook provides an experimental interface to the partial search
API by providing a `partial_search` method that can be used instead of
the `search` method in your recipes.

The `partial_search` method allows you to retrieve just the attributes
of interest. For example, you can execute a search to return just the
name and IP addresses of the nodes in your infrastructure rather than
receiving an array of complete node objects and post-processing them.

DEPRECATION
===========
Chef Client 12.0 shipped with the partial_search capability built-in
so there is no longer a need to use this cookbook.


Install
=======

Upload this cookbook and include it in the dependencies of any
cookbook where you would like to use `partial_search`.

Usage
=====

When you call `partial_search`, you need to specify the key paths of the
attributes you want returned. Key paths are specified as an array
of strings. Each key path is mapped to a short name of your
choosing. Consider the following example:
   
    partial_search(:node, 'role:web',
       :keys => { 'name' => [ 'name' ],
                  'ip'   => [ 'ipaddress' ],
                  'kernel_version' => [ 'kernel', 'version' ]
                }
    ).each do |result|
      puts result['name']
      puts result['ip']
      puts result['kernel_version']
    end

In the example above, two attributes will be extracted (on the
server) from the nodes that match the search query. The result will
be a simple hash with keys 'name'  and 'ip'.

Notes
=====

* We would like your feedback on this feature and the interface
  provided by this cookbook. Please send comments to the chef-dev
  mailing list.

* The partial search API will eventually be available in the Open Source Chef
